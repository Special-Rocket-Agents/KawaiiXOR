## How to report a security vulnerability

First get on contact with us (best way is Issues or E-mail) and explain the vulnerability throughly.

We put the vulnerability on the top of README for people to know

If possible, you will try to fix the vulnerability and then make the PR

If not, we will temporarily make the repo archived and implement an alert to all Programs
