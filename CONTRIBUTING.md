# The KawaiiXOR / SplitXOR / SecureXOR Contributing Guidelines
- When contributing to README, Try to search for typos or impolitical sentences and see ways you can fix them; Once you feel it's good enough - Slap in the merge PR
- When making the algorithm better, TRY IT and DEBUG everything you can. Try to encrypt a sentence and the decrypt it and see if it works.
- When you've found a vulnerability, contact us or make an issue immediately first so we put it on the README while you (if possible) work to fix it.
- We **really** appreciate any User Interface improvement or fixes, so there's that too

You can always make an Issue to suggest a new entry on here
